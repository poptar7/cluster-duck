Welcome to the documentation pages for the RITSEC Cloud!

This documentation is split up into four sections: hosts, KBs, networks, and
processes. See below for more information on each section.

While all efforts are made to keep this documentation up-to-date, sometimes
they may fall out of sync with the actual state of the RITSEC Cloud. If you see
something that looks different than what's documented here, please contribute
your findings!

Sections
--------

### [Host Pages](./hosts/README.md)

This section contains documentation on all **managed hosts** in the RITSEC
Cloud. Managed hosts are those that are created and operated by the RITSEC
Operations Program and any networks which are used for club operations.

### [Knowledge Base Articles](./kbs/README.md)

This section contains the RITSEC Operations Program's knowledge base articles.
These articles are meant to document the various problems that have been
encountered while operating the RITSEC Cloud. Other important-to-know events
that effect more than just a single host or network can be documented here as
well.

### [Network Pages](./networks/README.md)

This section contains documentation on all **managed networks**. Managed
networks, much like managed hosts, are those that are created and operated by
the RITSEC Operations Program and any networks which are used for club
operations.

### [Processes](./processes/README.md)

This section contains documentation on installation procedures, tasks that may
be performed more than once or twice, and any other processes which are
normally performed that may be helpful to document.
