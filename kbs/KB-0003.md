# KB-0003: Horizon KeyError on /project/network-topology/

With the current OpenStack-Ansible deployment of Horizon, a KeyError will be
thrown when navigating to /project/network-topology/, and project limits will
not be displayed properly on most pages.

## Problem

[A bug report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/1837483) was
submitted for this bug with additional details about the issue.

## Solution

The template for `/etc/horizon/local_settings.py` needs to be manually updated
with the `enable_quotas` key.

1. Open `/etc/ansible/roles/os_horizon/templates/horizon_local_settings.py.j2`
   in a text editor on the node that will be used to run `openstack-ansible`.
2. Go to line 284 (or whichever part has the following setting):
```python
OPENSTACK_HYPERVISOR_FEATURES = {
    'can_set_mount_point': False,
    'can_set_password': {{ horizon_can_set_password }},
    'requires_keypair': False,
}
```
3. Add the following line to the dictionary:
```python
    'enable_quotas': True,
```
4. Re-run the `os-horizon-install.yml` playbook to apply the changes to the
   horizon nodes.
