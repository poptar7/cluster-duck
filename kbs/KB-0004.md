# KB-0004: C6100 Retirement

The PowerEdge C6100 node is being retired.

## Problem

Nodes running on the C6100 have had very strange, difficult-to-debug issues
since we have installed the operating systems on them. These include:

- OSes failing to boot
- inability to apply new networking settings after boot
- network settings not being applied automatically after boot
- severe difficulties using the IPMI console

This node has proven to be more trouble than it is worth, so we will no longer
be using it in the cluster. We should keep as much of the RAM as possible to
reduce the cost of future hardware purchases, however.

## Solution

mgmt01-03 have been moved to the nodes previously hosting nova01-03, and nova06
is currently out of service.
