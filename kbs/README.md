# Knowledge Base Articles

This section contains the RITSEC Operations Program's knowledge base articles.
These articles are meant to document the various problems that have been
encountered while operating the RITSEC Cloud. Other important-to-know events
that effect more than just a single host or network can be documented here as
well.

Whenever a problem is encountered (such as a service going down unexpectedly),
a new KB article should be create by copying the [template](./TEMPLATE.md) to a
new file in this directory. The article should be given the next available KB
number, and the article should describe the problem and the solution in as much
detail as possible. The _Solution_ section of the article should be written in
the same style as a process page. The idea behind this is to reduce the amount
of effort required in the future to troubleshoot problems, and to build up as
much collective knowledge as possible.
